PHP is a widely-used, open-source scripting language primarily designed for web development. 
It stands for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor" and was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994. 
PHP is especially well-suited for server-side web development, where it's often used to create dynamic web pages or to build web applications.

Here are some key features of PHP:

1. Open Source: PHP is free to use and distribute, making it accessible to developers worldwide.

2. Server-Side Scripting: PHP code is executed on the server, generating HTML which is then sent to the client's web browser. This allows for dynamic content generation, such as retrieving data from a database or processing form submissions.

3. Cross-Platform Compatibility: PHP runs on various platforms including Windows, Linux, macOS, and others, making it versatile for different server environments.

4. Integration: PHP can be easily embedded within HTML code, allowing developers to mix PHP with HTML to create dynamic web pages.

5. Database Support: PHP offers built-in support for many databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and others, enabling developers to interact with databases seamlessly.

6. Extensive Community and Resources: PHP has a large and active community of developers, providing a wealth of documentation, tutorials, libraries, and frameworks to facilitate development.

7. Flexibility: PHP can be used for various tasks beyond web development, such as command-line scripting and GUI applications.

Overall, PHP remains a popular choice for web development due to its simplicity, versatility, and extensive ecosystem of tools and resources.
